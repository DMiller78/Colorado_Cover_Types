# Colorado_Cover_Types


Data Science - Machine Learning project for Thinkful data science program 4/2019

Goals

a. Predicting cover type (most common with this dataset).

b. Using machine learning algorithms to define Wilderness Areas based on available features

c. Probabilities with Bayesian models to predict soil types of the cover types.

d. Predicting Fire points based on features

e. Elevation, Slope, Aspect influence the soil types?

f. Why is the certain cover type more predominant over others in this region of Colorado? (Bring in cited literature)

g. How can machine learning classification models help led to the management decision of the Roosevelt forest in colorado?


Models

Logistic Regression; Naive Bayes; Xgboost; Random Forest
